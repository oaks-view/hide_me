A  steganography  implementation using the python programming language, stepic library and kivy. 
For now the project is still in its definitive stage so to speak. You can only convert .docx files for now. Also theres is a dedicated image being used as the medium for saving data.
Offcourse you will need a python interpreter, and kivy, with the stepic library on your machine.
Python 2.7.9 was the version of choice for this project. And thats all you need to get it running.
Simply execute the command "python main.py" in a command terminal and this will gets things running.
Best Regards.
